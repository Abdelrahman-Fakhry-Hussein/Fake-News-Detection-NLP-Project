# Fake-News-Detection-NLP-Project
Fake news spreads like a wildfire and this is a big issue in this era. You can learn how to distinguish fake news from a real one. You can use supervised learning to implement a model like this.
# Fake News Detection Project

## Idea
  ► A type of yellow journalism, fake news encapsulates pieces of news that may be
  hoaxes and is generally spread through social media and other online media. This is
  often done to further or impose certain ideas and is often achieved with political
  agendas. Such news items may contain false and/or exaggerated claims and may
  end up being virtualized by algorithms, and users may end up in a filter bubble.

## Fake News Detection (Techniques)

  ► To convert text , TF-IDF will be applied
  
  ► Then classify the news to real and fake using dataset news , implementing and classifier
  like PassiveAggressiveClassifier

## Fake News Detection (Dataset )

  ► we’ll call it news.csv. This dataset has a shape of 7796×4. The first column identifies
  the news, the second and third are the title and text, and the fourth column has labels
  denoting whether the news is REAL or FAKE.
